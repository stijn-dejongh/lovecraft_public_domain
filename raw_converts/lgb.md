 "Heave to, there's something floating to the leeward " the speaker was a short
stockily built man whose name was William Jones. he was the captain of a small cat boat in which
he &amp; a party of men were sailing at the time the story opens.  

   "Aye aye sir " answered John Towers &amp; the boat was brought to
a stand still Captain Jones reached out his hand for the object which he now discerned to be
a glass bottle  "Nothing but a rum flask that the men on a passing boat threw over "
he said but from an impulse of curiosity he reached out for it. it was a rum flask &amp; he
was about to throw it away when he noticed a piece of paper in it. He pulled it out &amp; on
it read the following  

  Jan 1 1864  
I am John Jones who writes this letter my ship is fast sinking with a treasure on board I am
where it is marked * on the enclosed chart  

  Captain Jones turned the sheet over &amp; the other side was a chart  

          

on the edge were written these words  

    dotted lines represent course we took    

   "Towers " Said Capt. Jones exitedly  "read this " Towers
did as he was directed  "I think it would pay to go " said Capt. Jones  "do you "?
 "Just as you say " replied Towers.  "We'll charter a schooner this very
day " said the exited captain  "All right " said Towers so they hired a boat
and started off govnd by the dotted lines of they chart in 4 weeks the reached the place where
directed &amp; the divers went down and came up with an iron bottle they found in it the following
lines scribbled on a piece of brown paper  

  Dec 3 1880  

Dear Searcher excuse me for the practical joke I have played on you but it serves you right
to find nothing for your foolish act--  

   "Well it does " said Capt Jones  "go on "  

  However I will defray your expenses to &amp; from the place you found your bottle
I think it will be $25.0.00 so that amount you will find in an Iron box I know where you found
the bottle because I put this bottle here &amp; the iron box &amp; then found a good place to
put the second bottle hoping the enclosed money will defray your expenses some I close--Anonymus "  

 "I'd like to kick his head off " said Capt Jones  "Here diver go &amp;
get the $25.0.00 in a minute the diver came up bearing an iron box inside it was found $25.0.00
It defrayed their expenses but I hardly think that they will ever go to a mysterious place as
directed by a mysterious bottle.
