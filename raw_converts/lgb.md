&ldquo;Heave to, there&rsquo;s something floating to the leeward&rdquo; the speaker was a short
stockily built man whose name was William Jones. he was the captain of a small cat boat in which
he &amp; a party of men were sailing at the time the story opens.  

  &ldquo;Aye aye sir&rdquo; answered John Towers &amp; the boat was brought to
a stand still Captain Jones reached out his hand for the object which he now discerned to be
a glass bottle &ldquo;Nothing but a rum flask that the men on a passing boat threw over&rdquo;
he said but from an impulse of curiosity he reached out for it. it was a rum flask &amp; he
was about to throw it away when he noticed a piece of paper in it. He pulled it out &amp; on
it read the following  

  Jan 1 1864  
I am John Jones who writes this letter my ship is fast sinking with a treasure on board I am
where it is marked * on the enclosed chart  

  Captain Jones turned the sheet over &amp; the other side was a chart  

          

on the edge were written these words  

    dotted lines represent course we took    

  &ldquo;Towers&rdquo; Said Capt. Jones exitedly &ldquo;read this&rdquo; Towers
did as he was directed &ldquo;I think it would pay to go&rdquo; said Capt. Jones &ldquo;do you&rdquo;?
&ldquo;Just as you say&rdquo; replied Towers. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll charter a schooner this very
day&rdquo; said the exited captain &ldquo;All right&rdquo; said Towers so they hired a boat
and started off govnd by the dotted lines of they chart in 4 weeks the reached the place where
directed &amp; the divers went down and came up with an iron bottle they found in it the following
lines scribbled on a piece of brown paper  

  Dec 3 1880  

Dear Searcher excuse me for the practical joke I have played on you but it serves you right
to find nothing for your foolish act&mdash;  

  &ldquo;Well it does&rdquo; said Capt Jones &ldquo;go on&rdquo;  

  However I will defray your expenses to &amp; from the place you found your bottle
I think it will be $25.0.00 so that amount you will find in an Iron box I know where you found
the bottle because I put this bottle here &amp; the iron box &amp; then found a good place to
put the second bottle hoping the enclosed money will defray your expenses some I close&mdash;Anonymus&rdquo;  

&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to kick his head off&rdquo; said Capt Jones &ldquo;Here diver go &amp;
get the $25.0.00 in a minute the diver came up bearing an iron box inside it was found $25.0.00
It defrayed their expenses but I hardly think that they will ever go to a mysterious place as
directed by a mysterious bottle.
