  Chapter 1.    

In the spring of 1847, the little village of Ruralville was thrown into a state of exitement by the
arrival of a strange brig in the harbour. It carried no flag, &amp; everything about it was such as
would exite suspicion. It had no name. Its captain was named Manuel Ruello. The exitement increased
however when John Griggs dissapeared from his home. This was Oct. 4. on Oct. 5 the brig was
gone.  

    Chapter 2.    

The brig, in leaving, was met by a U.S. Frigate and a sharp fight ensued. When
over, they  *   missed a man. named Henry Johns.  

    *(The Frigate.)    

    Chapter 3.    

The brig continued its course in the direction of Madagascar, upon its arrival,
The natives fled in all directions. When they came together on the other side of the island, one
was missing. His name was Dahabea.  

    Chapter 4.    

At length it was decided that something must be done. A reward of &pound;5,000 was
offered for the capture of Manuel Ruello., When startling news came, a nameless brig was wrecked on
the Florida Keys.  

    Chapter 5.    

A ship was sent to Florida, and the mystery was solved. In the exitement of the
fight they would launch a sub-marine boat and take what they wanted. there it lay, tranquilly
rocking on the waters of the Atlantic when someone called out &ldquo;John Brown has
dissapeared.&rdquo; And sure enough John Brown was gone.  

    Chapter 6.    

The finding of the sub-marine boat, and the dissapearance of John Brown, caused
renewed exitement amongst the people, when a new discovery was made. In transcribing this discovery
it is necessary to relate a geographical fact. At the N. Pole there exists a vast continent
composed of volcanic soil, a portion of which is open to explorers. It is called &ldquo;No-Mans
Land.&rdquo;  

    Chapter 7.    

In the extreme southern part of No-Mans Land, there was found a hut, and several
other signs of human habitation. they promptly entered, and, chained to the floor, lay Griggs,
Johns, &amp; Dahabea. They, upon arriving in London, separated, Griggs going to Ruralville, Johns
to the Frigate, &amp; Dahabea to Madagascar.  

    Chapter 8.    

But the mystery of John Brown was still unsolved, so they kept strict watch over
the port at No-Mans Land, and when the sub-marine boat arrived, and the pirates, one by one, and
headed by Manuel Ruello, left the ship, they were met by a rapid fire. After the fight brown was
recovered.  

    Chapter 9.    

Griggs was royally recieved at Ruralville, &amp; a dinner was given in honour of
Henry Johns, Dahabea was made King of Madagascar., &amp; Brown was made Captain of his ship.
