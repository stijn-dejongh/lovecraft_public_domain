EDITOR&rsquo;S NOTE: Alonzo Hasbrouck Typer of Kingston, N.Y., was last seen and recognised on
April 17, 1908, around noon, at the Hotel Richmond in Batavia. He was the only survivor of an
ancient Ulster County family, and was fifty-three years old at the time of his disappearance.  

  Mr. Typer was educated privately and at Columbia and Heidelberg Universities.
All his life was spent as a student; the field of his researches including many obscure and
generally feared borderlands of human knowledge. His papers on vampirism, ghouls, and poltergeist
phenomena were privately printed after rejection by many publishers. He resigned from the Society
for Psychical Research in 1902 after a series of peculiarly bitter controversies.  

  At various times Mr. Typer travelled extensively, sometimes dropping out of
sight for long periods. He is known to have visited obscure spots in Nepal, India, Thibet, and
Indo-China, and passed most of the year 1899 on mysterious Easter Island. The extensive search
for Mr. Typer after his disappearance yielded no results, and his estate was divided among distant
cousins in New York City.  

  The diary herewith presented was allegedly found in the ruins of a large country
house near Attica, N.Y., which had borne a curiously sinister reputation for generations before
its collapse. The edifice was very old, antedating the general white settlement of the region,
and had formed the home of a strange and secretive family named van der Heyl, which had migrated
from Albany in 1746 under a curious cloud of witchcraft suspicion. The structure probably dated
from about 1760.  

  Of the history of the van der Heyls very little is known. They remained entirely
aloof from their normal neighbours, employed negro servants brought directly from Africa and
speaking little English, and educated their children privately and at European colleges. Those
of them who went out into the world were soon lost to sight, though not before gaining evil
repute for association with Black Mass groups and cults of even darker significance.  

  Around the dreaded house a straggling village arose, populated by Indians and
later by renegades from the surrounding country, which bore the dubious name of Chorazin. Of
the singular hereditary strains which afterward appeared in the mixed Chorazin villagers, several
monographs have been written by ethnologists. Just behind the village, and in sight of the van
der Heyl house, is a steep hill crowned with a peculiar ring of ancient standing stones which
the Iroquois always regarded with fear and loathing. The origin and nature of the stones, whose
date, according to archaeological and climatological evidence, must be fabulously early, is
a problem still unsolved.  

  From about 1795 onward, the legends of the incoming pioneers and later population
have much to say about strange cries and chants proceeding at certain seasons from Chorazin
and from the great house and hill of standing stones; though there is reason to suppose that
the noises ceased about 1872, when the entire van der Heyl household&mdash;servants and all&mdash;suddenly
and simultaneously disappeared.  

  Thenceforward the house was deserted; for other disastrous events&mdash;including
three unexplained deaths, five disappearances, and four cases of sudden insanity&mdash;occurred
when later owners and interested visitors attempted to stay in it. The house, village, and extensive
rural areas on all sides reverted to the state and were auctioned off in the absence of discoverable
van der Heyl heirs. Since about 1890 the owners (successively the late Charles A. Shields and
his son Oscar S. Shields, of Buffalo) have left the entire property in a state of absolute neglect,
and have warned all inquirers not to visit the region.  

  Of those known to have approached the house during the last forty years, most
were occult students, police officers, newspaper men, and odd characters from abroad. Among
the latter was a mysterious Eurasian, probably from Cochin-China, whose later appearance with
blank mind and bizarre mutilations excited wide press notice in 1903.  

  Mr. Typer&rsquo;s diary&mdash;a book about 6 &times; 3&frac12; inches in size, with
tough paper and an oddly durable binding of thin sheet metal&mdash;was discovered in the possession
of one of the decadent Chorazin villagers on Nov. 16, 1935, by a state policeman sent to investigate
the rumoured collapse of the deserted van der Heyl mansion. The house had indeed fallen, obviously
from sheer age and decrepitude, in the severe gale of Nov. 12. Disintegration was peculiarly
complete, and no thorough search of the ruins could be made for several weeks. John Eagle, the
swarthy, simian-faced, Indian-like villager who had the diary, said that he found the book quite
near the surface of the debris, in what must have been an upper front room.  

  Very little of the contents of the house could be identified, though an enormous
and astonishingly solid brick vault in the cellar (whose ancient iron door had to be blasted
open because of the strangely figured and perversely tenacious lock) remained intact and presented
several puzzling features. For one thing, the walls were covered with still undeciphered hieroglyphs
roughly incised in the brickwork. Another peculiarity was a huge circular aperture in the rear
of the vault, blocked by a cave-in evidently caused by the collapse of the house.  

  But strangest of all was the apparently   recent   deposit of some foetid,
slimy, pitch-black substance on the flagstoned floor, extending in a yard-broad, irregular line
with one end at the blocked circular aperture. Those who first opened the vault declared that
the place smelled like the snake-house at a zoo.  

  The diary, which was apparently designed solely to cover an investigation of
the dreaded van der Heyl house by the vanished Mr. Typer, has been proved by handwriting experts
to be genuine. The script shews signs of increasing nervous strain as it progresses toward the
end, in places becoming almost illegible. Chorazin villagers&mdash;whose stupidity and taciturnity
baffle all students of the region and its secrets&mdash;admit no recollection of Mr. Typer as
distinguished from other rash visitors to the dreaded house.  

  The text of the diary is here given verbatim and without comment. How to interpret
it, and what, other than the writer&rsquo;s madness, to infer from it, the reader must decide
for himself. Only the future can tell what its value may be in solving a generation-old mystery.
It may be remarked that genealogists confirm Mr. Typer&rsquo;s belated memory in the matter of
  Adriaen Sleght.    

    THE DIARY    

    April 17, 1908    

  Arrived here about 6 p.m. Had to walk all the way from Attica in the teeth
of an oncoming storm, for no one would rent me a horse or rig, and I can&rsquo;t run an automobile.
This place is even worse than I had expected, and I dread what is coming, even though I long
at the same time to learn the secret. All too soon will come the night&mdash;the old Walpurgis
Sabbat horror&mdash;and after that time in Wales I know what to look for. Whatever comes, I shall
not flinch. Prodded by some unfathomable urge, I have given my whole life to the quest of unholy
mysteries. I came here for nothing else, and will not quarrel with fate.  

  It was very dark when I got here, though the sun had by no means set. The storm-clouds
were the densest I had ever seen, and I could not have found my way but for the lightning flashes.
The village is a hateful little backwater, and its few inhabitants no better than idiots. One
of them saluted me in a queer way, as if he knew me. I could see very little of the landscape&mdash;just
a small, swampy valley of strange brown weed-stalks and dead fungi surrounded by scraggly, evilly
twisted trees with bare boughs. But behind the village is a dismal-looking hill on whose summit
is a circle of great stones with another stone at the centre. That, without question, is the
vile primordial thing V&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; told me about at the N&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; estbat.  

  The great house lies in the midst of a park all overgrown with curious-looking
briers. I could scarcely break through, and when I did the vast age and decrepitude of the building
almost stopped me from entering. The place looked filthy and diseased, and I wondered how so
leprous a bulk could hang together. It is wooden; and though its original lines are hidden by
a bewildering tangle of wings added at various dates, I think it was first built in the square
colonial fashion of New England. Probably that was easier to build than a Dutch stone house&mdash;and
then, too, I recall that Dirck van der Heyl&rsquo;s wife was from Salem, a daughter of the unmentionable
Abaddon Corey. There was a small pillared porch, and I got under it just as the storm burst.
It was a fiendish tempest&mdash;black as midnight, with rain in sheets, thunder and lightning
like the day of general dissolution, and a wind that actually clawed at me. The door was unlocked,
so I took out my electric torch and went inside. Dust was inches thick on floor and furniture,
and the place smelled like a mould-caked tomb. There was a hall reaching all the way through,
and a curving staircase on the right. I ploughed a way upstairs and selected this front room
to camp out in. The whole place seems fully furnished, though most of the furniture is breaking
down. This is written at eight o&rsquo;clock, after a cold meal from my travelling-case. After
this the village people will bring me supplies&mdash;though they won&rsquo;t agree to come any
closer than the ruins of the park gate until (as they say) later. I wish I could get rid of
an unpleasant feeling of familiarity with this place.  

      Later    

  I am conscious of several presences in this house. One in particular is decidedly
hostile toward me&mdash;a malevolent will which is seeking to break down my own and overcome me.
I must not countenance this for an instant, but must use all my forces to resist it. It is appallingly
evil, and definitely non-human. I think it must be allied to powers outside earth&mdash;powers
in the spaces behind time and beyond the universe. It towers like a colossus, bearing out what
is said in the Aklo writings. There is such a feeling of vast size connected with it that I
wonder these chambers can contain its bulk&mdash;and yet it has no visible bulk. Its age must
be unutterably vast&mdash;shockingly, indescribably so.  

      April 18    

  Slept very little last night. At 3 a.m. a strange, creeping wind began to pervade
the whole region&mdash;ever rising until the house rocked as if in a typhoon. As I went down
the staircase to see to the rattling front door the darkness took half-visible forms in my imagination.
Just below the landing I was pushed violently from behind&mdash;by the wind, I suppose, though
I could have sworn I saw the dissolving outlines of a gigantic black paw as I turned quickly
about. I did not lose my footing, but safely finished the descent and shot the heavy bolt of
the dangerously shaking door.  

  I had not meant to explore the house till dawn; yet now, unable to sleep again
and fired with mixed terror and curiosity, I felt reluctant to postpone my search. With my powerful
torch I ploughed through the dust to the great south parlour, where I knew the portraits would
be. There they were, just as V&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; had said, and as I seemed to know from some
obscurer source as well. Some were so blackened, mouldy, and dust-clouded that I could make
little or nothing of them, but from those I could trace I recognised that they were indeed of
the hateful line of the van der Heyls. Some of the paintings seemed to suggest faces I had known;
but just   what   faces, I could not recall.  

  The outlines of that frightful hybrid Joris&mdash;spawned in 1773 by old Dirck&rsquo;s
youngest daughter&mdash;were clearest of all, and I could trace the green eyes and the serpent
look in his face. Every time I shut off the flashlight that face would seem to glow in the dark
until I half fancied it shone with a faint, greenish light of its own. The more I looked, the
more evil it seemed, and I turned away to avoid hallucinations of changing expression.  

  But that to which I turned was even worse. The long, dour face, small, closely
set eyes, and swine-like features identified it at once, even though the artist had striven
to make the snout look as human as possible. This was what V&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; had whispered
about. As I stared in horror, I thought the eyes took on a reddish glow&mdash;and for a moment
the background seemed replaced by an alien and seemingly irrelevant scene&mdash;a lone, bleak
moor beneath a dirty yellow sky, whereon grew a wretched-looking blackthorn bush. Fearing for
my sanity, I rushed from that accursed gallery to the dust-cleared corner upstairs where I have
my &ldquo;camp&rdquo;.  

      Later    

  Decided to explore some of the labyrinthine wings of the house by daylight.
I cannot get lost, for my footprints are distinct in the ankle-deep dust&mdash;and I can trace
other identifying marks when necessary. It is curious how easily I learn the intricate windings
of the corridors. Followed a long, outflung northerly &ldquo;ell&rdquo; to its extremity, and
came to a locked door, which I forced. Beyond was a very small room quite crowded with furniture,
and with the panelling badly worm-eaten. On the outer wall I spied a black space behind the
rotting woodwork, and discovered a narrow secret passage leading downward to unknown black depths.
It was a steeply inclined chute or tunnel without steps or hand-holds, and I wondered what its
use could have been.  

  Above the fireplace was a mouldy painting, which I found on close inspection
to be that of a young woman in the dress of the late eighteenth century. The face is of classic
beauty, yet with the most fiendishly evil expression which I have ever known the human countenance
to bear. Not merely callousness, greed, and cruelty, but some quality hideous beyond human comprehension
seems to sit upon those finely carved features. And as I looked it seemed to me that the artist&mdash;or
the slow processes of mould and decay&mdash;had imparted to that pallid complexion a sickly greenish
cast, and the least suggestion of an almost imperceptibly scaly texture. Later I ascended to
the attic, where I found several chests of strange books&mdash;many of utterly alien aspect in
letters and in physical form alike. One contained variants of the Aklo formulae which I had
never known to exist. I have not yet examined the books on the dusty shelves downstairs.  

      April 19    

  There are certainly unseen presences here, even though the dust as yet bears
no footprints but my own. Cut a path through the briers yesterday to the park gate where my
supplies are left, but this morning I found it closed. Very odd, since the bushes are hardly
stirring with spring sap. Again I had that feeling of something at hand so colossal that the
chambers can scarcely contain it. This time I feel more than one of the presences is of such
a size, and I know now that the third Aklo ritual&mdash;which I found in that book in the attic
yesterday&mdash;would make such beings solid and visible. Whether I shall dare to try this materialisation
remains to be seen. The perils are great.  

  Last night I began to glimpse evanescent shadow-faces and forms in the dim
corners of the halls and chambers&mdash;faces and forms so hideous and loathsome that I dare
not describe them. They seem allied in substance to that titanic paw which tried to push me
down the stairs night before last&mdash;and must of course be phantoms of my disturbed imagination.
What I am seeking would not be quite like these things. I have seen the paw again&mdash;sometimes
alone and sometimes with its mate&mdash;but I have resolved to ignore all such phenomena.  

  Early this afternoon I explored the cellar for the first time&mdash;descending
by a ladder found in a storeroom, since the wooden steps had rotted away. The whole place is
a mass of nitrous encrustations, with amorphous mounds marking the spots where various objects
have disintegrated. At the farther end is a narrow passage which seems to extend under the northerly
&ldquo;ell&rdquo; where I found the little locked room, and at the end of this is a heavy brick
wall with a locked iron door. Apparently belonging to a vault of some sort, this wall and door
bear evidences of eighteenth-century workmanship and must be contemporary with the oldest additions
to the house&mdash;clearly pre-Revolutionary. On the lock&mdash;which is obviously older than
the rest of the ironwork&mdash;are engraved certain symbols which I cannot decipher.  

  V&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; had not told me about this vault. It fills me with a greater
disquiet than anything else I have seen, for every time I approach it I have an almost irresistible
impulse to   listen   for something. Hitherto no untoward   sounds   have marked my stay
in this malign place. As I left the cellar I wished devoutly that the steps were still there&mdash;for
my progress up the ladder seemed maddeningly slow. I do not want to go down there again&mdash;and
yet some evil genius urges me to try it   at night   if I would learn what is to be learned.  

      April 20    

  I have sounded the depths of horror&mdash;only to be made aware of still lower
depths. Last night the temptation was too strong, and in the black small hours I descended once
more into that nitrous, hellish cellar with my flashlight&mdash;tiptoeing among the amorphous
heaps to that terrible brick wall and locked door. I made no sound, and refrained from whispering
any of the incantations I knew, but I listened&mdash;listened with mad intentness.  

  At last I heard the sounds from beyond those barred plates of sheet iron&mdash;the
menacing padding and muttering, as of gigantic night-things within. Then, too, there was a damnable
slithering, as of a vast serpent or sea-beast dragging its monstrous folds over a paved floor.
Nearly paralysed with fright, I glanced at the huge rusty lock, and at the alien, cryptic hieroglyphs
graven upon it. They were signs I could not recognise, and something in their vaguely Mongoloid
technique hinted at a blasphemous and indescribable antiquity. At times I fancied I could see
them glowing with a greenish light.  

  I turned to flee, but found that vision of the titan paws before me&mdash;the
great talons seeming to swell and become more tangible as I gazed. Out of the cellar&rsquo;s
evil blackness they stretched, with shadowy hints of scaly wrists beyond them, and with a waxing,
malignant will guiding their horrible gropings. Then I heard from behind me&mdash;within that
abominable vault&mdash;a fresh burst of muffled reverberations which seemed to echo from far
horizons like distant thunder. Impelled by this greater fear, I advanced toward the shadowy
paws with my flashlight and saw them vanish before the full force of the electric beam. Then
up the ladder I raced, torch between my teeth, nor did I rest till I had regained my upstairs
&ldquo;camp&rdquo;.  

  What is to be my ultimate end, I dare not imagine. I came as a seeker, but
now I know that something is seeking me. I could not leave if I wished. This morning I tried
to go to the gate for my supplies, but found the briers twisted tightly in my path. It was the
same in every direction&mdash;behind and on all sides of the house. In places the brown, barbed
vines had uncurled to astonishing heights&mdash;forming a steel-like hedge against my egress.
The villagers are connected with all this. When I went indoors I found my supplies in the great
front hall, though without any clue to how they came there. I am sorry now that I swept the
dust away. I shall scatter some more and see what prints are left.  

  This afternoon I read some of the books in the great shadowy library at the
rear of the ground floor, and formed certain suspicions which I cannot bear to mention. I had
never seen the text of Pnakotic Manuscripts or of the Eltdown Shards before, and would not have
come here had I known what they contain. I believe it is too late now&mdash;for the awful Sabbat
is only ten days away. It is for that night of horror that   they   are saving me.  

      April 21    

  I have been studying the portraits again. Some have names attached, and I noticed
one&mdash;of an evil-faced woman, painted some two centuries ago&mdash;which puzzled me. It bore
the name of Trintje van der Heyl Sleght, and I have a distinct impression that I once met the
name of Sleght before, in some significant connexion. It was not horrible then, though it becomes
so now. I must rack my brain for the clue.  

  The   eyes   of these pictures haunt me. Is it possible that some of them
are emerging more distinctly from their shrouds of dust and decay and mould? The serpent-faced
and swine-faced warlocks stare horribly at me from their blackened frames, and a score of other
hybrid faces are beginning to peer out of shadowy backgrounds. There is a hideous look of family
resemblance in them all&mdash;and that which is human is more horrible than that which is non-human.
I wish they reminded me less of other faces&mdash;faces I have known in the past. They were an
accursed line, and Cornelis of Leyden was the worst of them. It was   he   who broke down
the barrier after his father had found that other key. I am sure that V&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; knows
only a fragment of the horrible truth, so that I am indeed unprepared and defenceless. What
of the line before old Claes? What he did in 1591 could never have been done without generations
of evil heritage, or some link with the outside. And what of the branches this monstrous line
has sent forth? Are they scattered over the world, all awaiting their common heritage of horror?
I must recall the place where I once so particularly noticed the name of Sleght.  

  I wish I could be sure that these pictures stay always in their frames. For
several hours now I have been seeing momentary presences like the earlier paws and shadow-faces
and forms, but closely duplicating some of the ancient portraits. Somehow I can never glimpse
a presence and the portrait it resembles at the same time&mdash;the light is always wrong for
one or the other, or else the presence and the portrait are in different rooms.  

  Perhaps, as I have hoped, the presences are mere figments of imagination; but
I cannot be sure now. Some are female, and of the same hellish beauty as the picture in the
little locked room. Some are like no portrait I have seen, yet make me feel that their painted
features lurk unrecognised beneath the mould and soot of canvases I cannot decipher. A few,
I desperately fear, have approached materialisation in solid or semi-solid form&mdash;and some
have a dreadful and unexplained familiarity.  

  There is one woman who in fell loveliness excels all the rest. Her poisonous
charms are like a honeyed flower growing on the brink of hell. When I look at her closely she
vanishes, only to reappear later. Her face has a greenish cast, and now and then I fancy I can
spy a suspicion of the squamose in its smooth texture. Who is she? Is she that being who must
have dwelt in the little locked room a century and more ago?  

  My supplies were again left in the front hall&mdash;that, clearly, is to be
the custom. I had sprinkled dust about to catch footprints, but this morning the whole hall
was swept clean by some unknown agency.  

      April 22    

  This has been a day of horrible discovery. I explored the cobwebbed attic again,
and found a carved, crumbling chest&mdash;plainly from Holland&mdash;full of blasphemous books
and papers far older than any hitherto encountered here. There was a Greek   Necronomicon,  
a Norman-French   Livre d&rsquo;Eibon,   and a first edition of old Ludvig Prinn&rsquo;s   
De Vermis Mysteriis.   But the old bound manuscript was the worst. It was in low Latin, and
full of the strange, crabbed handwriting of Claes van der Heyl&mdash;being evidently the diary
or notebook kept by him between 1560 and 1580. When I unfastened the blackened silver clasp
and opened the yellowed leaves a coloured drawing fluttered out&mdash;the likeness of a monstrous
creature resembling nothing so much as a squid, beaked and tentacled, with great yellow eyes,
and with certain abominable approximations to the human form in its contours.  

  I had never before seen so utterly loathsome and nightmarish a form. On the
paws, feet, and head-tentacles were curious claws&mdash;reminding me of the colossal shadow-shapes
which have groped so horribly in my path&mdash;while the entity as a whole sat upon a great throne-like
pedestal inscribed with unknown hieroglyphs of vaguely Chinese cast. About both writing and
image there hung an air of sinister evil so profound and pervasive that I could not think it
the product of any one world or age. Rather must that monstrous shape be a focus for all the
evil in unbounded space, throughout the aeons past and to come&mdash;and those eldritch symbols
be vile sentient eikons endowed with a morbid life of their own and ready to wrest themselves
from the parchment for the reader&rsquo;s destruction. To the meaning of that monster and of
those hieroglyphs I had no clue, but I knew that both had been traced with a hellish precision
and for no namable purpose. As I studied the leering characters, their kinship to the symbols
on that ominous lock in the cellar became more and more manifest. I left the picture in the
attic, for never could sleep come to me with such a thing nearby.  

  All the afternoon and evening I read in the manuscript book of old Claes van
der Heyl, and what I read will cloud and make horrible whatever period of life lies ahead of
me. The genesis of the world, and of previous worlds, unfolded itself before my eyes. I learned
of the city Shamballah, built by the Lemurians fifty million years ago, yet inviolate still
behind its walls of psychic force in the eastern desert. I learned of the Book of Dzyan, whose
first six chapters antedate the earth, and which was old when the lords of Venus came through
space in their ships to civilise our planet. And I saw recorded in writing for the first time
that name which others had spoken to me in whispers, and which I had known in a closer and more
horrible way&mdash;the shunned and dreaded name of   Yian-Ho.    

  In several places I was held up by passages requiring a key. Eventually, from
various allusions, I gathered that old Claes had not dared to embody all his knowledge in one
book, but had left certain points for another. Neither volume can be wholly intelligible without
its fellow; hence I have resolved to find the second one if it lies anywhere within this accursed
house. Though plainly a prisoner, I have not lost my lifelong zeal for the unknown; and am determined
to probe the cosmos as deeply as possible before doom comes.  

      April 23    

  Searched all the morning for the second diary, and found it about noon in a
desk in the little locked room. Like the first, it is in Claes van der Heyl&rsquo;s barbarous
Latin; and it seems to consist of disjointed notes referring to various sections of the other.
Glancing through the leaves, I spied at once the abhorred name of Yian-Ho&mdash;of Yian-Ho, that
lost and hidden city wherein brood aeon-old secrets, and of which dim memories older than the
body lurk behind the minds of all men. It was repeated many times, and the text around it was
strown with crudely drawn hieroglyphs plainly akin to those on the pedestal in that hellish
drawing I had seen. Here, clearly, lay the key to that monstrous tentacled shape and its forbidden
message. With this knowledge I ascended the creaking stairs to the attic of cobwebs and horror.  

  When I tried to open the attic door it stuck as never before. Several times
it resisted every effort to open it, and when at last it gave way I had a distinct feeling that
some colossal, unseen shape had suddenly released it&mdash;a shape that soared away on non-material
but audibly beating wings. When I found the horrible drawing I felt that it was not precisely
where I had left it. Applying the key in the other book, I soon saw that the latter was no instant
guide to the secret. It was only a clue&mdash;a clue to a secret too black to be left lightly
guarded. It would take hours&mdash;perhaps days&mdash;to extract the awful message.  

  Shall I live long enough to learn the secret? The shadowy black arms and paws
haunt my vision more and more now, and seem even more titanic than at first. Nor am I ever long
free from those vague, unhuman presences whose nebulous bulk seems too vast for the chambers
to contain. And now and then the grotesque, evanescent faces and forms, and the mocking portrait-shapes,
troop before me in bewildering confusion.  

  Truly, there are terrible primal arcana of earth which had better be left unknown
and unevoked; dread secrets which have nothing to do with man, and which man may learn only
in exchange for peace and sanity; cryptic truths which make the knower evermore an alien among
his kind, and cause him to walk alone on earth. Likewise are there dread survivals of things
older and more potent than man; things that have blasphemously straggled down through the aeons
to ages never meant for them; monstrous entities that have lain sleeping endlessly in incredible
crypts and remote caverns, outside the laws of reason and causation, and ready to be waked by
such blasphemers as shall know their dark forbidden signs and furtive passwords.  

      April 24    

  Studied the picture and the key all day in the attic. At sunset I heard strange
sounds, of a sort not encountered before and seeming to come from far away. Listening, I realised
that they must flow from that queer abrupt hill with the circle of standing stones, which lies
behind the village and some distance north of the house. I had heard that there was a path from
the house leading up that hill to the primal cromlech, and had suspected that at certain seasons
the van der Heyls had much occasion to use it; but the whole matter had hitherto lain latent
in my consciousness. The present sounds consisted of a shrill piping intermingled with a peculiar
and hideous sort of hissing or whistling&mdash;a bizarre, alien kind of music, like nothing which
the annals of earth describe. It was very faint, and soon faded, but the matter has set me thinking.
It is toward the hill that the long, northerly &ldquo;ell&rdquo; with the secret chute, and the
locked brick vault under it, extend. Can there be any connexion which has so far eluded me?  

      April 25    

  I have made a peculiar and disturbing discovery about the nature of my imprisonment.
Drawn toward the hill by a sinister fascination, I found the briers giving way before me,   
but in that direction only.   There is a ruined gate, and beneath the bushes the traces of
the old path no doubt exist. The briers extend part way up and all around the hill, though the
summit with the standing stones bears only a curious growth of moss and stunted grass. I climbed
the hill and spent several hours there, noticing a strange wind which seems always to sweep
around the forbidding monoliths and which sometimes seems to whisper in an oddly articulate
though darkly cryptic fashion.  

  These stones, both in colour and in texture, resemble nothing I have seen elsewhere.
They are neither brown nor grey, but rather of a dirty yellow merging into an evil green and
having a suggestion of chameleon-like variability. Their texture is queerly like that of a scaled
serpent, and is inexplicably nauseous to the touch&mdash;being as cold and clammy as the skin
of a toad or other reptile. Near the central menhir is a singular stone-rimmed hollow which
I cannot explain, but which may possibly form the entrance to a long-choked well or tunnel.
When I sought to descend the hill at points away from the house I found the briers intercepting
me as before, though the path toward the house was easily retraceable.  

      April 26    

  Up on the hill again this evening, and found that windy whispering much more
distinct. The almost angry humming came close to actual speech&mdash;of a vague sibilant sort&mdash;and
reminded me of the strange piping chant I had heard from afar. After sunset there came a curious
flash of premature summer lightning on the northern horizon, followed almost at once by a queer
detonation high in the fading sky. Something about this phenomenon disturbed me greatly, and
I could not escape the impression that the noise ended in a kind of unhuman hissing speech which
trailed off into guttural cosmic laughter. Is my mind tottering at last, or has my unwarranted
curiosity evoked unheard-of horrors from the twilight spaces? The Sabbat is close at hand now.
What will be the end?  

      April 27    

  At last my dreams are to be realised! Whether or not my life or spirit or body
will be claimed, I shall enter the gateway! Progress in deciphering those crucial hieroglyphs
in the picture has been slow, but this afternoon I hit upon the final clue. By evening I knew
their meaning&mdash;and that meaning can apply in only one way to the things I have encountered
in this house.  

  There is beneath this house&mdash;sepulchred I know not where&mdash;an ancient
forgotten One who will shew me the gateway I would enter, and give me the lost signs and words
I shall need. How long It has lain buried here&mdash;forgotten save by those who reared the stones
on the hill, and by those who later sought out this place and built this house&mdash;I cannot
conjecture. It was in search of this Thing, beyond question, that Hendrik van der Heyl came
to New-Netherland in 1638. Men of this earth know It not, save in the secret whispers of the
fear-shaken few who have found or inherited the key. No human eye has even yet glimpsed It&mdash;unless,
perhaps, the vanished wizards of this house delved farther than has been guessed.  

  With knowledge of the symbols came likewise a mastery of the Seven Lost Signs
of Terror&mdash;and a tacit recognition of the hideous and unutterable Words of Fear. All that
remains for me to accomplish is the Chant which will transfigure that Forgotten One who is Guardian
of the Ancient Gateway. I marvel much at the Chant. It is composed of strange and repellent
gutturals and disturbing sibilants resembling no language I have ever encountered&mdash;even
in the blackest chapters of the   Livre d&rsquo;Eibon.   When I visited the hill at sunset
I tried to read it aloud, but evoked in response only a vague, sinister rumbling on the far
horizon, and a thin cloud of elemental dust that writhed and whirled like some evil living thing.
Perhaps I do not pronounce the alien syllables correctly, or perhaps it is only on the Sabbat&mdash;that
hellish Sabbat for which the Powers in this house are without question holding me&mdash;that
the great Transfiguration can occur.  

  Had an odd spell of fright this morning. I thought for a moment that I recalled
where I had seen that baffling name of Sleght before, and the prospect of realisation filled
me with unutterable horror.  

      April 28    

  Today dark ominous clouds have hovered intermittently over the circle on the
hill. I have noticed such clouds several times before, but their contours and arrangements now
hold a fresh significance. They are snake-like and fantastic, and curiously like the evil shadow-shapes
I have seen in the house. They float in a circle around the primal cromlech&mdash;revolving repeatedly
as though endowed with a sinister life and purpose. I could swear, too, that they give forth
an angry murmuring. After some fifteen minutes they sail slowly away, ever to the eastward,
like the units of a straggling battalion. Are they indeed those dread Ones whom Solomon knew
of old&mdash;those giant black beings whose number is legion and whose tread doth shake the earth?  

  I have been rehearsing the Chant that will transfigure the Nameless Thing,
yet strange fears assail me even when I utter the syllables under my breath. Piecing all evidence
together, I have now discovered that the only way to It is through the locked cellar vault.
That vault was built with a hellish purpose, and must cover the hidden burrow leading to the
Immemorial Lair. What guardians live endlessly within, flourishing from century to century on
an unknown nourishment, only the mad may conjecture. The warlocks of this house, who called
them out of inner earth, have known them only too well, as the shocking portraits and memories
of the place reveal.  

  What troubles me most is the limited nature of the Chant. It evokes the Nameless
One, yet provides no method for the control of That Which is evoked. There are, of course, the
general signs and gestures, but whether they will prove effective toward such an One remains
to be seen. Still, the rewards are great enough to justify any danger&mdash;and I could not retreat
if I would, since an unknown force plainly urges me on.  

  I have discovered one more obstacle. Since the locked cellar vault must be
traversed, the key to that place must be found. The lock is infinitely too strong for forcing.
That the key is somewhere hereabouts cannot be doubted, but the time before the Sabbat is very
short. I must search diligently and thoroughly. It will take courage to unlock that iron door,
for what prisoned horrors may not lurk within?  

      Later    

  I have been shunning the cellar for the past day or two, but late this afternoon
I again descended to those forbidding precincts. At first all was silent, but within five minutes
the menacing padding and muttering began once more beyond the iron door. This time it was loud
and more terrifying than on any previous occasion, and I likewise recognised the slithering
that bespoke some monstrous sea-beast&mdash;now swifter and nervously intensified, as if the
thing were striving to force its way through the portal to where I stood.  

  As the pacing grew louder, more restless, and more sinister, there began to
pound through it those hellish and unidentifiable reverberations which I had heard on my second
visit to the cellar&mdash;those muffled reverberations which seemed to echo from far horizons
like distant thunder. Now, however, their volume was magnified an hundredfold, and their timbre
freighted with new and terrifying implications. I can compare the sound to nothing more aptly
than to the roar of some dread monster of the vanished saurian age, when primal horrors roamed
the earth, and Valusia&rsquo;s serpent-men laid the foundation-stones of evil magic. To such
a roar&mdash;but swelled to deafening heights reached by no known organic throat&mdash;was this
shocking sound akin. Dare I unlock the door and face the onslaught of what lies beyond?  

      April 29    

  The key to the vault is found. I came upon it this noon in the little locked
room&mdash;buried beneath rubbish in a drawer of the ancient desk, as if some belated effort
to conceal it had been made. It was wrapped in a crumbling newspaper dated Oct. 31, 1872; but
there was an inner wrapping of dried skin&mdash;evidently the hide of some unknown reptile&mdash;which
bore a Low Latin message in the same crabbed writing as that of the notebooks I found. As I
had thought, the lock and key were vastly older than the vault. Old Claes van der Heyl had them
ready for something he or his descendants meant to do&mdash;and how much older than he they were
I could not estimate. Deciphering the Latin message, I trembled in a fresh access of clutching
terror and nameless awe.  

  &ldquo;The secrets of the monstrous primal Ones,&rdquo; ran the crabbed text,
&ldquo;whose cryptic words relate the hidden things that were before man; the things no one of
earth should learn, lest peace be forever forfeited; shall by me never suffer revelation. To
Yian-Ho, that lost and forbidden city of countless aeons whose place may not be told, I have
been in the veritable flesh of this body, as none other among the living has been. Therein have
I found, and thence have I borne away, that knowledge which I would gladly lose, though I may
not. I have learnt to bridge a gap that should not be bridged, and must call out of the earth
That Which should not be waked or called. And what is sent to follow me will not sleep till
I or those after me have found and done what is to be found and done.  

  &ldquo;That which I have awaked and borne away with me, I may not part with
again. So is it written in the Book of Hidden Things. That which I have willed to be has twined
its dreadful shape around me, and&mdash;if I live not to do the bidding&mdash;around those children
born and unborn who shall come after me, until the bidding be done. Strange may be their joinings,
and awful the aid they may summon till the end be reached. Into lands unknown and dim must the
seeking go, and a house must be built for the outer Guardians.  

  &ldquo;This is the key to that lock which was given me in the dreadful, aeon-old,
and forbidden city of Yian-Ho; the lock which I or mine must place upon the vestibule of That
Which is to be found. And may the Lords of Yaddith succour me&mdash;or him&mdash;who must set
that lock in place or turn the key thereof.&rdquo;  

  Such was the message&mdash;a message which, once I had read it, I seemed to
have known before. Now, as I write these words, the key is before me. I gaze on it with mixed
dread and longing, and cannot find words to describe its aspect. It is of the same unknown,
subtly greenish frosted metal as the lock; a metal best compared to brass tarnished with verdigris.
Its design is alien and fantastic, and the coffin-shaped end of the ponderous bulk leaves no
doubt of the lock it was meant to fit. The handle roughly forms a strange, non-human image,
whose exact outlines and identity cannot now be traced. Upon holding it for any length of time
I seem to feel an alien, anomalous   life   in the cold metal&mdash;a quickening or pulsing too
feeble for ordinary recognition. Below the eidolon is graven a faint, aeon-worn legend in those
blasphemous, Chinese-like hieroglyphs I have come to know so well. I can make out only the
beginning&mdash;the words &ldquo;my vengeance lurks&rdquo;&mdash;before the text fades to
indistinctness. There is some fatality in this timely finding of the key&mdash;  for tomorrow
night comes the hellish Sabbat.   But strangely enough, amidst all this hideous expectancy,
that question of the Sleght name bothers me more and more. Why should I dread to find it linked
with the van der Heyls?  

      Walpurgis-Eve&mdash;April 30    

  The time has come. I waked last night to see the sky glowing with a lurid greenish
radiance&mdash;that same morbid green which I have seen in the eyes and skin of certain portraits
here, on the shocking lock and key, on the monstrous menhirs of the hill, and in a thousand
other recesses of my consciousness. There were strident whispers in the air&mdash;sibilant whistlings
like those of the wind around that dreadful cromlech. Something spoke to me out of the frore
aether of space, and it said, &ldquo;The hour falls.&rdquo; It is an omen, and I laugh at my own
fears. Have I not the dread words and the Seven Lost Signs of Terror&mdash;the power coercive
of any Dweller in the cosmos or in the unknown darkened spaces? I will no longer hesitate.  

  The heavens are very dark, as if a terrific storm were coming on&mdash;a storm
even greater than that of the night when I reached here, nearly a fortnight ago. From the village&mdash;less
than a mile away&mdash;I hear a queer and unwonted babbling. It is as I thought&mdash;these poor
degraded idiots are within the secret, and keep the awful Sabbat on the hill. Here in the house
the shadows gather densely. In the darkness the key before me almost glows with a greenish light
of its own. I have not yet been to the cellar. It is better that I wait, lest the sound of that
muttering and padding&mdash;those slitherings and muffled reverberations&mdash;unnerve me before
I can unlock the fateful door.  

  Of what I shall encounter, and what I must do, I have only the most   general  
idea. Shall I find my task in the vault itself, or must I burrow deeper into the nighted heart
of our planet? There are things I do not yet understand&mdash;or at least, prefer not to
understand&mdash;despite a dreadful, increasing, and inexplicable sense of bygone familiarity with
this fearsome house. That chute, for instance, leading down from the little locked room. But I
think I know why the wing with the vault extends toward the hill.  

      6 p.m.    

  Looking out the north windows, I can see a group of villagers on the hill.
They seem unaware of the lowering sky, and are digging near the great central menhir. It occurs
to me that they are working on that stone-rimmed hollow place which looks like a long-choked
tunnel entrance. What is to come? How much of the olden Sabbat rites have these people retained?
That key glows horribly&mdash;it is not imagination. Dare I use it as it must be used? Another
matter has greatly disturbed me. Glancing nervously through a book in the library I came upon
an ampler form of the name that has teased my memory so sorely: Trintje, wife of Adriaen Sleght.
The   Adriaen   leads me to the very brink of recollection.  

      Midnight    

  Horror is unleashed, but I must not weaken. The storm has broken with pandaemoniac
fury, and lightning has struck the hill three times, yet the hybrid, malformed villagers are
gathering within the cromlech. I can see them in the almost constant flashes. The great standing
stones loom up shockingly, and have a dull green luminosity that reveals them even when the
lightning is not there. The peals of thunder are deafening, and every one seems to be horribly
  answered   from some indeterminate direction. As I write, the creatures on the hill have
begun to chant and howl and scream in a degraded, half-simian version of the ancient ritual.
Rain pours down like a flood, yet they leap and emit sounds in a kind of diabolic ecstasy.  

    &ldquo;I&auml;! Shub-Niggurath! The Goat with a Thousand Young!&rdquo;    

  But the worst thing is within the house. Even at this height, I have begun
to hear sounds from the cellar.   It is the padding and muttering and slithering and muffled
reverberations within the vault.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.    

  Memories come and go. That name of Adriaen Sleght pounds oddly at my consciousness.
Dirck van der Heyl&rsquo;s son-in-law&mdash;his child old Dirck&rsquo;s granddaughter and Abaddon
Corey&rsquo;s great-granddaughter.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  

      Later    

  Merciful God!   At last I know where I saw that name.   I know, and am transfixed
with horror. All is lost.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  

  The key has begun to feel warm as my left hand nervously clutches it. At times
that vague quickening or pulsing is so distinct that I can almost feel the living metal move.
It came from Yian-Ho for a terrible purpose, and to me&mdash;who all too late know the thin stream
of van der Heyl blood that trickles down through the Sleghts into my own lineage&mdash;has descended
the hideous task of fulfilling that purpose.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  

  My courage and curiosity wane. I know the horror that lies beyond that iron
door. What if Claes van der Heyl was my ancestor&mdash;need I expiate his nameless sin?   I
will not&mdash;I swear I will not!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.    

  [  Writing here grows indistinct  ]  

  Too late&mdash;cannot help self&mdash;black paws materialise&mdash;am dragged
away toward the cellar.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
