# Thematic and stylistic groupings

H.P. Lovecraft's works can be categorized into several thematic and stylistic groups. While _"The Cthulhu Mythos"_ and _"The Dream Cycle"_ are the
most
famous, there are other categories that encompass his diverse range of stories:

* **The Cthulhu Mythos:** This includes stories featuring Lovecraft's pantheon of ancient, cosmic deities and the lore surrounding them. Key
  stories include _"The Call of Cthulhu"_, _"At the Mountains of Madness"_, and _"The Shadow over Innsmouth"_.
* **The Dream Cycle (or Dreamlands):** These stories are set in a fantastical, dream-like realm. Notable works include _"The Dream-Quest of Unknown
  Kadath"_, _"The Cats of Ulthar"_, and _"The Silver Key"_.
* **The Arkham Cycle:** Stories set in the fictional New England towns of Arkham, Dunwich, Innsmouth, and Kingsport. These towns often overlap with
  the Cthulhu Mythos. Important stories include _"The Dunwich Horror"_, _"The Colour Out of Space"_, and _"The Shadow over Innsmouth"_.
* **The Miskatonic University Stories:** These stories revolve around the fictional Miskatonic University, which appears in many of Lovecraft's
  works, often as a repository of forbidden knowledge and arcane books like the Necronomicon. Stories include _"Herbert West – Reanimator"_, _"The
  Dunwich Horror"_, and _"The Whisperer in Darkness"_
* **The Providence Stories:** Stories inspired by Lovecraft's hometown of Providence, Rhode Island, and often featuring antiquarian themes.
  Examples are _"The Case of Charles Dexter Ward"_ and _"The Haunter of the Dark"_.
* **Macabre and Gothic Tales:** These stories emphasize horror and the macabre without necessarily fitting into the larger mythos or dream cycles.
  Examples include _"The Outsider"_, _"The Rats in the Walls"_, and _"The Picture in the House"_.
* **Collaborations and Ghostwritten Stories:** Lovecraft ghostwrote or revised stories for other authors, often incorporating his own mythos
  elements. Notable examples are _"The Mound"_ (with Zealia Bishop), _"The Diary of Alonzo Typer"_ (with William Lumley), and _"The Horror in the
  Museum"_ (with Hazel Heald).
* **Poetry and Non-Fiction:** Though less known, Lovecraft wrote a significant amount of poetry and non-fiction, including essays on writing,
  travelogues, and letters that provide insight into his thoughts and influences.

These categories help organize Lovecraft's extensive body of work and highlight the recurring themes and settings that define his unique
contribution to the genre of weird fiction.

# The Lovecraft Universe: Timeline and Key Events

The timeline of Lovecraft's universe is a vast and complex chronology that spans eons, detailing the rise and fall of cosmic entities and ancient
civilizations. The universe is populated by a pantheon of ancient, powerful, and malevolent entities known as the Great Old Ones. These beings
are so ancient and powerful that they are incomprehensible to humanity. In general, the cosmic entities in Lovecraft's universe are indifferent
to the fate of humanity. Their actions might seem malevolent, but they are simply following their own alien motives.

To help readers navigate the Lovecraft universe, we have compiled a list of the most important events in the timeline of the Lovecraft Universe.

## Pre-human Era

* **The Creation of the Universe**: The universe is formed. Azathoth, the blind idiot god, resides at the center of the cosmos, surrounded by
  lesser
  deities.
* **The Arrival of the Great Old Ones**: Entities like Cthulhu, Yog-Sothoth, and Nyarlathotep come into existence. They are timeless and exist
  beyond
  human comprehension.
* **The Coming of Elder Things**: The Elder Things arrive on Earth and establish a great civilization. They create the first life forms, including
  the shoggoths.

## Ancient Civilizations

* **Rise of the Great Race of Yith**: The Yithians, a race of time-travelers, migrate their consciousnesses into other species throughout time and
  space. They establish a civilization on Earth and create extensive libraries and archives.
* **The Reign of Cthulhu and R'lyeh**: Cthulhu and his spawn come to Earth, establishing the sunken city of R'lyeh in the Pacific Ocean. Cthulhu's
  influence spreads, and his cults form among pre-human races.
* **The War with the Elder Gods**: A cosmic battle occurs between the Great Old Ones and the Elder Gods, resulting in the imprisonment of many
  Great
  Old Ones, including Cthulhu, who is trapped beneath the ocean in R'lyeh.

## Human Era

* **Rise of Human Civilizations**: Human civilizations begin to form, including those in Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Mesoamerica. Occult knowledge and
  fragments of the Mythos lore are discovered and passed down through secret cults and forbidden texts.
* **Hyperborea and Mu**: Ancient human civilizations like Hyperborea and Mu rise and fall, each having contact with or worshiping entities from the
  Mythos. These civilizations possess advanced knowledge and magic.

## Historical and Modern Era

* **Ancient Greece and Rome**: The Greeks and Romans have limited knowledge of the Mythos, with some individuals encountering artifacts and cults
  related to the Great Old Ones and Elder Gods.
* **The Middle Ages**: The Necronomicon, a key Mythos text written by Abdul Alhazred, is rediscovered and translated into Latin. Occult practices
  and
  secret societies flourish in Europe.
* **19th and 20th Centuries**: Lovecraft's stories are set primarily in the 1920s and 1930s, a time when scholars, cultists, and explorers uncover
  ancient horrors. Key events include:
    * **The Shadow over Innsmouth**: The discovery of the Deep One hybrid community in Innsmouth.
    * **The Call of Cthulhu**: The awakening and temporary rise of Cthulhu from R'lyeh.
    * **At the Mountains of Madness**: The exploration of Antarctica and the discovery of the Elder Things' ancient city.

## Future and Beyond

* **The Return of the Great Old Ones**: Prophecies and hints in the Mythos suggest a future time when the stars align correctly, and the Great Old
  Ones will return to reclaim the Earth, bringing about the end of human civilization as we know it.

This timeline encapsulates the cyclical nature of the Mythos, where ancient cosmic entities periodically interact with human history, often leading
to catastrophic and horrifying outcomes. Lovecraft's work emphasizes the insignificance of humanity in the face of these vast, timeless forces.

# Eldritch Horrors: A Guide to Lovecraftian Entities

The Lovecraft Mythos features a pantheon of ancient and powerful entities, often categorized as Elder Gods, Great Old Ones, and other eldritch
beings. This section contains an overview of these beings, starting from the oldest and most significant entities, and moving down the hierarchy.
This hierarchy illustrates the complex and terrifying cosmology of Lovecraft's Mythos, where humanity is but a tiny, insignificant part of a vast
and indifferent universe filled with ancient beings of unimaginable power. These entities, from the omnipotent Elder Gods to the monstrous Great Old
Ones and the advanced Elder Things.

The Elder Gods are typically depicted as neutral - sometimes almost benevolent - deities that oppose the Great Old Ones and other malevolent
entities. They are less frequently mentioned in Lovecraft’s original works and are more prominent in the writings of later authors like August
Derleth.

  cosmic entities, Nyarlathotep is active and frequently interacts with humans, often driving them mad.

  figure, spawning countless monstrous offspring.

  R’lyeh. Cthulhu's cultists await his awakening, which will signal the end of human civilization.

gods but highly advanced beings.

  and established an advanced civilization on Earth, notably in Antarctica (as described in _"At the Mountains of Madness"_).
