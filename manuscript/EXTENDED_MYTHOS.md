H.P. Lovecraft has inspired many other writers over the years, leading to the creation of an extended mythos that expands upon the themes,
creatures, and cosmic horror elements found in his original works. This extended mythos, while retaining thematic similarities to Lovecraft’s other
works, often introduces new concepts and settings that do not directly reference the established elements of the Cthulhu Mythos or Dreamlands.
Lovecraft’s influence permeates these stories, as his pioneering vision of cosmic dread, and the insignificance of humanity in the face of
incomprehensible forces has become a foundational aspect of modern horror literature.

As H.P. Lovecraft was involved in a literary circle that included other writers such as __Robert E. Howard__, __Clark Ashton Smith__, and __August
Derleth__, he co-authored many stories and corresponded with these authors, leading to a shared universe of cosmic horror that has continued to grow
and evolve over the years. This collaboration and mutual inspiration gave rise to a broader mythos that extends beyond Lovecraft’s solo works,
enriching the tapestry of supernatural horror with diverse voices and imaginative expansions. These writers, while bringing their unique styles
and perspectives, adhered to the core principles of Lovecraft’s vision: the fear of the unknown, the fragility of sanity, and the presence of
ancient, malevolent entities lurking beyond the veil of reality.

This book contains a selection of stories from the extended mythos that showcase the diverse range of narratives and styles that emerged from
Lovecraft's creative mind and his collaborative circle. Included are tales that delve into the depths of forbidden knowledge, explore uncharted
realms of terror, and present encounters with entities that defy human comprehension. For legal reasons, we have included only those stories that
are in the public domain, ensuring that readers can enjoy these works without any copyright restrictions. Through these stories, readers will
experience the richness of the extended Lovecraft Mythos, a testament to the enduring legacy of H.P. Lovecraft and his profound impact on the genre
of horror.
