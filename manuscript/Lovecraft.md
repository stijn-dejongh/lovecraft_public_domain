Born in Providence, Rhode Island, Lovecraft spent most of his life in New England. After his father's institutionalization in 1893, he lived
affluently until his family's wealth dissipated after the death of his grandfather. Lovecraft then lived with his mother, in reduced financial
security, until her institutionalization in 1919. He began to write essays for the United Amateur Press Association, and in 1913 wrote a critical
letter to a pulp magazine that ultimately led to his involvement in pulp fiction. He became active in the speculative fiction community and was
published in several pulp magazines. Lovecraft moved to New York City, marrying Sonia Greene in 1924, and later became the center of a wider group
of authors known as the "Lovecraft Circle". They introduced him to Weird Tales, which became his most prominent publisher. Lovecraft's time in New
York took a toll on his mental state and financial conditions. He returned to Providence in 1926 and produced some of his most popular works,
including "The Call of Cthulhu", At the Mountains of Madness, The Shadow over Innsmouth, and The Shadow Out of Time. He remained active as a writer
for 11 years until his death from intestinal cancer at the age of 46. 

## The Lovecraft Universe

The timeline of Lovecraft's universe is a vast and complex chronology that spans eons, detailing the rise and fall of cosmic entities and ancient
civilizations. The universe is populated by a pantheon of ancient, powerful, and malevolent entities known as the Great Old Ones. These beings 
are so ancient and powerful that they are incomprehensible to humanity. In general, the cosmic entities in Lovecraft's universe are indifferent 
to the fate of humanity. Their actions might seem malevolent, but they are simply following their own alien motives. 

To help readers navigate the Lovecraft universe, we have compiled a list of the most important events in the timeline of the Lovecraft Universe.

### Pre-human Era

* **The Creation of the Universe**: The universe is formed. Azathoth, the blind idiot god, resides at the center of the cosmos, surrounded by 
  lesser 
deities.
* **The Arrival of the Great Old Ones**: Entities like Cthulhu, Yog-Sothoth, and Nyarlathotep come into existence. They are timeless and exist 
  beyond 
human comprehension.
* **The Coming of Elder Things**: The Elder Things arrive on Earth and establish a great civilization. They create the first life forms, including 
the shoggoths.

### Ancient Civilizations

* **Rise of the Great Race of Yith**: The Yithians, a race of time-travelers, migrate their consciousnesses into other species throughout time and 
space. They establish a civilization on Earth and create extensive libraries and archives.
* **The Reign of Cthulhu and R'lyeh**: Cthulhu and his spawn come to Earth, establishing the sunken city of R'lyeh in the Pacific Ocean. Cthulhu's 
influence spreads, and his cults form among pre-human races.
* **The War with the Elder Gods**: A cosmic battle occurs between the Great Old Ones and the Elder Gods, resulting in the imprisonment of many 
  Great 
Old Ones, including Cthulhu, who is trapped beneath the ocean in R'lyeh.

### Human Era

* **Rise of Human Civilizations**: Human civilizations begin to form, including those in Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Mesoamerica. Occult knowledge and 
fragments of the Mythos lore are discovered and passed down through secret cults and forbidden texts.
* **Hyperborea and Mu**: Ancient human civilizations like Hyperborea and Mu rise and fall, each having contact with or worshiping entities from the 
Mythos. These civilizations possess advanced knowledge and magic.

### Historical and Modern Era

* **Ancient Greece and Rome**: The Greeks and Romans have limited knowledge of the Mythos, with some individuals encountering artifacts and cults 
related to the Great Old Ones and Elder Gods.
* **The Middle Ages**: The Necronomicon, a key Mythos text written by Abdul Alhazred, is rediscovered and translated into Latin. Occult practices 
  and 
secret societies flourish in Europe.
* **19th and 20th Centuries**: Lovecraft's stories are set primarily in the 1920s and 1930s, a time when scholars, cultists, and explorers uncover 
ancient horrors. Key events include:
  * **The Shadow over Innsmouth**: The discovery of the Deep One hybrid community in Innsmouth.
  * **The Call of Cthulhu**: The awakening and temporary rise of Cthulhu from R'lyeh. 
  * **At the Mountains of Madness**: The exploration of Antarctica and the discovery of the Elder Things' ancient city.

### Future and Beyond

* **The Return of the Great Old Ones**: Prophecies and hints in the Mythos suggest a future time when the stars align correctly, and the Great Old 
Ones will return to reclaim the Earth, bringing about the end of human civilization as we know it.

This timeline encapsulates the cyclical nature of the Mythos, where ancient cosmic entities periodically interact with human history, often leading
to catastrophic and horrifying outcomes. Lovecraft's work emphasizes the insignificance of humanity in the face of these vast, timeless forces.
