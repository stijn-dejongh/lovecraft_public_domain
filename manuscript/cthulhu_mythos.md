From _“Dagon”_ to _“The Call of Cthulhu”_ to _“The Haunter of the Dark”_, each story connects to the ancient cosmic entities known as the Great Old
Ones, buried in a deep sleep beneath the earth and incomprehensible to mankind. For the few mortals who dare to glimpse this unknowable world, the
result is a complete disconnection from what was once considered reality. Lovecraft’s stories are grim, fantastical, dark, horrifying—and yet
endlessly fascinating.  

Lovecraft created a universe of cosmic horror fiction that features a pantheon of ancient, powerful, and malevolent entities. The central
figure, Cthulhu, is a massive, tentacled Great Old One who lies dormant beneath the ocean in the sunken city of R'lyeh. Lovecraft's mythos includes
other deities and creatures, such as _Nyarlathotep_, _Yog-Sothoth_, and _Azathoth_, as well as a variety of human and non-human cultists who 
worship these beings. The stories are known for their themes of forbidden knowledge, the insignificance of humanity in the face of vast, incomprehensible forces,
and the fragility of sanity.
