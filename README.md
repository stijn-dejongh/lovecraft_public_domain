# lovecraft_public_domain

Public Domain short stories by HP Lovecraft in Markua format.

This repository contains the original stories which Lovecraft wrote as an adult. 
It begins in 1917 with “The Tomb” and ends in 1935 with his last original work “The Haunter of the Dark.” 
The book is ordered chronologically by the date the story was written. Because Lovecraft was a terrible businessman 
and left no heirs to his intellectual property, all of his works are already in the public domain.
